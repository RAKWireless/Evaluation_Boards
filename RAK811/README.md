# RAK811_LoRaWAN_Arduino 
2019.12.30


Firstly, thank you very much to .@sabas1080 for his contribution on RAK811 LoRa Tracker board + Arduino.

1. What is Arduino?
If you know little about Arduino, please have a look below:  
[https://www.arduino.cc/](https://www.arduino.cc/)

2. You have known Arduino.  Install the IDE first:  
[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

3. What lib is used?  
RAK811 is based on STM32L151.Therefore Arduino Core for Arduino_Core_STM32 is suitable for RAK811.

4. How to install Arduino_Core_STM32 in Arduino?  
[https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32)  
add "https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/master/STM32/package_stm_index.json" to **Additional Boards Manager URLs:** option  
![install Arduino_Core_STM32](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Wisblock/blob/master/res/image/install%20Arduino_Core_STM32.png)  
Check the other lib below install or not?
![Check Cores](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Wisblock/blob/master/res/image/Check%20Cores.png)
Then install the BSP for STM32.
If install completed as following:
![install board](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Wisblock/blob/master/res/image/install%20Board.png)
5. Download the LoRaWAN library from below. It is a very tiny lorawan protocol only support ABP mode for now, if you want to use OTAA, you can develop it yourself in the lib:  

https://github.com/adafruit/TinyLoRa 

![LoRaWAN library](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Wisblock/blob/master/res/lib.png)
6. OK, development environment is finished. Open the Arduino_RAK811_LoRaWAN.inoï¼Œconfig 3 parameters for LoRaWAN_ABP. The demo is test in US915. If you want to define other region, you should change in the lib, the path in your pc maybe C:\Users\..\Documents\Arduino\libraries\TinyLoRa\TinyLoRa.h :  
![config 3 parameters](https://github.com/RAKWireless/Wisblock/blob/master/res/config.png)  

7. Compile and download via Arduino IDE.

You can download firware to board via Arduino, What need?
1. Install STM32CubeProgrammer from https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html
2. Choose in Arduino: Tools->Upload method:"STM32CubeProgrammer(Serial)"
3. Connect Boot0 to VDD, you can find it on back of wisblock, then reset
4. Click Download in Arduino, it will automatically download. 

8. When download ok, the Gateway and server are working properly.  
The RAK811 will be auto send data to server:
