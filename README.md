# Wisblock

### 1 Introduction
WisBlock series modules are a series of stacked board built by RAK company
for IoT industry. WisBlock modules support dozens of CPUs, sensors and
interface circuit boards. It can build circuits like building blocks quickly to realize
your idea, and through high-speed connectors and fasteners interconnection, it
can directly compose the reliable industrial products. 

WisBlock series modules are divided into WisBase module, WisDuo module, WisSensor module and WisIO module. 

RAK5005 WisBase module is a base board of WisBlock, which can be
connected with CPU, Sensor and IO through the connector of the board, and
provides direct databus interconnection of these modules on the base board. WisBase module also integrates the power supply circuit to realize low power
battery power supply. In order to facilitate users, WisBase has reserved USB
ports, indicator lights, keys and extended IO interfaces. 

WisDuo module is the core computing unit and wireless connection unit of the
WisBlock products. It integrates MCU, LoRa, BLE and other wireless
transceiver modules. The data collected by sensors can be processed and sent
to the cloud through LoRa wireless links. BLE can also be used to achieve
short-range communication and indoor positioning function. 

The WisSensor module is integrated with a MEMS sensor, which can support
dozens of different sensors. Each WisBase board can support up to four
different sensors. Through different sensor combinations, specific data
acquisition can be achieved quickly. Sensors on WisSensor are designed with
low power consumption to extend battery life.

WisIO module can flexibly expand various application interfaces, such as
industrial sensor interface, display interface, other wireless protocol extension,
WisBlock
4
button and LED indicator expansion, can be quickly implemented on WisIO
board. 

WisBlock supports a set of open source hardware architecture. Users can also
use the standard connectors of WisBlock to develop their own specific function
modules, with standard WisBlock modules, quickly develop your own products
to meet the needs of different industries. 

WisBlock series boards are not only functional testability products in product
development verification stage, but also industrial products oriented to mass
production. It uses a high-speed connector to ensure the integrity of the signal. At the same time, it is equipped with fastening screw, which can be used in
vibration environment. And WisBlock products can be used reliably in various
civil and industrial scenarios through rigorous reliability tests. 

WisBlock uses a compact stacked hardware design, which integrates various
computing, connecting and sensor circuits in the size of 60*30mm. The
compact size makes it easy for users to build in various customized housings
to achieve complete products. RAK also have a series of housings for
WisBlock modules, which can meet the requirements of various protection
levels.

WisBlock series modules are not only for rapid implementation of engineering
prototype, but also can be used with RAK industrial protective housing to
compose industrial products. Under the unified management of WisDM, a
complete solution of IoT is formed by wireless aggregation of node data
through RAK industrial gateway.

### 7 Electrical and Mechanical Specifications

Stresses above those listed as “absolute maximum ratings” may cause
permanent damage to the device. This is a stress rating, functional operation of
the device under these conditions is not advised. Exposure to maximum rating
conditions may affect device reliability

### 8 WisBlock Module in Production

RAK5005 supports kinds of module, according to the function and the position on
the RAK5005, they are classified into three categories:

WisDuo: containing MCU and wireless link transceiver. 

WisSensor: integrate mems sensor

WisIO: to extend IO, power supply and sensors.
